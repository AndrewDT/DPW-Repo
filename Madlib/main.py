At least 2 mathematical operators
Two conditional statements
(with at least one logical operator)

It must have and use parameters
One loop - Remember that this is for repeating code!
And meet the following requirements:

The mad lib's code must be well commented and include the appropriate use of Docstrings
All elements should have a purpose within the greater madlib. (In other words you can't create an array or function that isn't used)
You must make at least 12 meaningful commits to this file in your repository or your assignment will earn a 0.
Any errors will earn an automatic ZERO on this assignment.
